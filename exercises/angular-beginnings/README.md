# Angular Beginnings

### My First Foray Into Angular

This exercise was to practice setting up a basic Angular app.

**Requirements**

1. Load Angular framework from a CDN
2. Create an Angular module
3. Create an Angular controller
4. Have a model that is tied to a scope object
5. Have an input box that is tied to that same scope object
6. When you type in the input box, the label should immediately be updated with the text that is typed (using *ng-model*)
