# Mike The Mink

-----

###### Warmup

----

Out of playful maliciousness you have decided to add this picture of a mink to every page in your favorite state website. Every time someone hovers their mouse over the image, it disappears. And that's all the functionality.

The directive will be called `mike-the-mink` (Normalized to `mikeTheMink`) and you should be able to use it like this:

`<mike-the-mink></mike-the-mink>`

Place this directive in random places on every page of the favorite state website.
